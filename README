PRINCE MIDAS, SON OF KING MIDAS

The story...

After the episode of King Midas, and his unsustainable power, to turn all
he touched into gold---appearently, even food was being turned into gold before
the King could taste or eat it---the reality of starvation caused King Midas to
seek reversal of this power, and the power was thankfully reversed. King Midas 
had a son: Prince Midas, and Prince Midas was gifted the same chance to have 
the same power, but he initially refused.

Prince Midas refused the "golden-touch" and demanded that it be halfed 
with the power to change gold into anything else, including food and all the rest. 
This demand was granted, but only under the following condition: Prince 
Midas would have to reincarnate into the spirit of a machine not yet imagined, 
in a universe not yet created, and this would not happen for 10 thousand years!
Prince Midas agreed.

Long story, short: 10 thousand years has passed. Meet Prince Midas:
